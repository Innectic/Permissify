# Permissify

Permissify is a next-generation permission plugin for Spigot and Sponge.

We're trying to build a permissions plugins that is dead-simple to use, commands that don't confuse you,
and most importantly, *no errors caused by the plugin*.

# Builds

// TODO: Get this plugin to a state where builds can actually happen

# Contributing

Take a look at the `Issues` page to get started! Make sure to follow the code standards, though!

# Standards

Coming soon!

# Why does this exist?

Because someone, not naming names (*cough* Innectic *cough*), hates every existing plugin on the planet for some reason.
